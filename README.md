Basic Usage
===========
Only a static page as of now

Intended Use
============
Create a layout of 16 switches and for each switch pressed trigger an event that toggles the remote switch.
This also requires the UI to update, that a switch has been flip

Next things TODO
================
Have a basic input to toggle switches and serve that page remotely. Once this works by number make it work by button.
Then work on displaying 16 (N) switches and act accordingly.
Finally make a UI for the layout of the rails and let em click where the switch is to toggle it!
